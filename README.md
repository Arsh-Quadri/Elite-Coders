NFT Marketplace
This is an NFT Marketplace application built using React, Solidity, and Alchemy. It allows users to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain.

Features
Users can create an account and connect their wallet to the application.
Users can browse and search for NFTs listed for sale on the marketplace.
Users can list their own NFTs for sale with a specified price.
Users can purchase NFTs from the marketplace using their connected wallet.
Transaction history is recorded on the blockchain for transparency.
Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

Node.js installed (version X.X.X)
Metamask extension installed in your browser
An Ethereum wallet for testing (e.g., Rinkeby or local development network)
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NFT-Marketplace.git
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd NFT-Marketplace
npm install
Configure Alchemy API

Create an account on Alchemy and obtain an API key.
Replace ALCHEMY_API_KEY in src/config.js with your Alchemy API key.
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the application in your browser:
arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Deploying the Smart Contracts
To deploy the Solidity smart contracts to the blockchain, follow these steps:

Update the deployment configuration in hardhat.config.js with your desired network and settings.

Compile the contracts:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the contracts:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
Replace <network-name> with the network where you want to deploy the contracts (e.g., rinkeby, localhost, etc.).

Once the deployment is successful, update the contract addresses and ABIs in the client application code (src/contracts/Marketplace.js) with the newly deployed contract details.
